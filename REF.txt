Build a CI/CD Pipeline! Your instructions are as follows:

Create a public github repository on your own account for the web application that you created for yesterdays EC2 exercise.
	Push your code to the repository
	Create a YAML file in the project root (call it buildspec.yml)
Create a pipeline with AWS CodePipeline
	Point CodeCommit to your public repo (use github version 2)
	Build with CodeBuild (likely mvn in your buildspec)
	Deploy to ElasticBeanstalk
